{: .warning }
Custom 3DS fonts replace the built-in system font, meaning you will see this font in all system apps, some homebrew apps, and some games. This can cause issues in certain games. Before using custom fonts, please read the info on [this page](./index.md).

## Description

DETERMINATION is a faithful recreation of the font used in *UNDERTALE*. It was originally uploaded to Behance by a user named [*Haley Wakamatsu*](https://www.behance.net/JapanYoshi) and was then ported to the Nintendo 3DS by the Preservia team.
