# Fonts
A growing collection of fonts ported to the Nintendo 3DS. 

{: .warning }
Never uninstall CFW while a custom font is installed. **This will fully brick your console!** If this happens you'll need a [DS flashcart with ntrboot](https://www.flashcarts.net/ds-quick-start-guide) to re-install boot9strap.

{: .notice }
It is recommended you create a NAND backup before installing custom fonts as you will be modifying system files. Doing so is safe since boot9strap provides brick protection but it is still recommended. If your home menu fails to launch after installing a custom font, view this section.

## How to Install a Font
1. Put a downloaded `.cia` file on your (micro)SD Card.
2. Turn your 3DS on while holding the `Start` button.
  1. If a menu opens, select `GodMode9` and press `A`.
3. Navigate to your SD Card, then to where your put your `.cia` and select it.
4. Select `CIA Image Options...` then `Install Game Image`.
5. Press `B` until you are on the main menu, then press `Start`

## Custom Font Compatibility

{: .notice }
Please be aware that custom fonts **overwrite the system font**. Games that use the system font will instead display your installed custom font, this may cause issues in certain games.

Here is a list of apps and games that use the system font for text in-game:
- Streetpass Mii Plaza
- Settings
- Tomodachi Life
- Miitopia
- Pilot Wings
- Super Mario Maker
- Chibi-Robo Photo Finder
- Kid Icarus Uprising
- Dillon's Dead-Heat Breakers

To remove a custom font, just reinstall the [System Font]() using the same method you used to install the custom one.
